				<h3 class="project__info__title">Challenge</h3>
				<p class="project__info__content">After reaching the second stage interview with Yourfeed, I was set a short brief to test my abilities. The brief was to create an app that would allow school leavers to see future options other than university. I thought it would be a good idea to add the project to my portfolio as it showcases how quickly I can work, and again shows my approach to a project.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="project__info">
				<h3 class="project__info__title">Approach</h3>
				<p class="project__info__content">Highlight key information in the brief, research the target audience, create a timeline to keep focused and showcase as many of my abilities as possible within the time I had. I also decided that the target audience, might not actually have a CV so I wanted to design something that eradicated that, and was based on skills and experiences. I also had to keep the project on brand with Yourfeed, so had to research into their brand identity.</p>

				<div class="project__process__content project__process__content--right">
					<h3 class="project__info__title">Research</h3>
					<p class="project__info__content">Before I could start I needed to fully understand the audience outlined in the brief and why this would be beneficial for them. Some of the topics I researched were the options school leavers had, services already trying to fill that gap and standard industry-leading job boards. I also research elements that Yourfeed was using, and created small library of elements to use.</p>

					<h3 class="project__info__title">Sketch</h3>
					<p class="project__info__content">Due to my time constraints, I planned out the rough user journey and decided on information needed to progress through the app. My time constraints also meant that I wouldn’t be able to experiment with structure, layout and hierarchy. However, as I was using the Yourfeed I already has some guidance as to what this should look like.</p>

				<div class="project__process__content project__process__content--right">
					<h3 class="project__info__title">Wireframe</h3>
					<p class="project__info__content">Due to the quick turnaround needed for this, I decided to only wireframe the profile creation process of the app. I did this so I could work out what information was required, allowing me to move on to high fidelity mockups for the applying for a job section. Doing this forced me to make decisions about what information was completely necessary and if the profile setup was quick and could potentially be done while commuting.</p>

					<h3 class="project__info__title">Mock ups</h3>
					<p class="project__info__content">I decided that I would showcase my ability to create high fidelity mockups with the applying for a job part of the app. Influenced by the information I had gathered about Yourfeed’s brand, I fused elements of their brand with personal touches I felt would make the process more engaging.</p>

		<h3 class="project__info__title">Results</h3>
		<p class="project__info__content">Overall, I was quite happy with what I had been able to achieve within the 10 hours. I felt that it showcased my abilities well and Yourfeed must of felt so too, as the interview was successful. If I were to continue with the project, I’d like to set up interviews with the target audience to understand their struggles and what they would benefit from.</p>
